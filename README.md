# Hi, I'm Lucas! I'm a front-end developer based in Toronto, Canada.

I specialize in transforming designs, prototypes, and ideas into delightful user interfaces.

I’ve been working in the industry since 2020, when I graduated from web development bootcamp at Juno College. The logical side of my brain loves solving tricky coding problems and software architecture challenges, while the creative side of my brain loves converting designs into beautiful and functional web pages that people use every day. I’m also passionate about making the web a more accessible place, one page at a time.
